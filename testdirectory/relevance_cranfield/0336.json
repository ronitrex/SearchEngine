  "body": "simplified laminar boundary layer calculations for bodies of revolution and for yawed wings . since the introduction of momentum methods in boundary-layer calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many improvements have been proposed .  an especially simple solution reduces the problem to a quadrature .  here, it is proposed to extend these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and to compressible laminar boundary-layer calculations .  for comparison, the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundary layer are also discussed briefly .",
