  "body": "some simple solutions to the problem of predicting boundary layer self-induced pressures . simplified theoretical approaches are shown, based on hypersonic similarity boundary-layer theory, which allow reasonably accurate estimates to be made of the surface pressures on plates on which viscous effects are important .  the consideration of viscous effects includes the cases where curved surfaces, stream pressure gradients, and leading-edge bluntness are important factors .",
