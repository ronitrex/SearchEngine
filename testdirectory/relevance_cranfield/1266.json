  "body": "minimum wing wave drag with volume constraint . a numerical method is developed for calculating the minimum thickness drag for a given wing planform and volume using linearized supersonic flow theory .  the corresponding optimum volume distribution is also determined .  the results show that considerable drag reduction is possible by improved volume distribution .",
