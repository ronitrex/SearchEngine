  "body": "three dimensional viscous wakes . the velocity fields of three-dimensional viscous wakes are examined with the use of the boundary-layer approximations, osoen's linearization of the convective terms, and the assumption of constant fluid properties .  transform methods yield solutions for general types of initial conditions .  as an illustration, the axial velocity distribution of a wake whose initial isovels (lines of constant velocity) are of elliptic shape and their decay to axial symmetry are demonstrated . both laminar and turbulent flows are considered .",
